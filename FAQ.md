# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## When will new binary releases be available via the API?

The API performs a full update that pulls in new binary releases every 24 hours. Therefore, from the point that a release is published on GitHub it can take up to 24 hours for it to appear in the API.

This [feature](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-api-v3/issues/304) will look to improve the lead time.
